# Smart AI Generation Alert Extension - Requirements Document

**Document ID:** REQ-AI-ALERT-1.0  
**Project Name:** Smart AI Generation Alert Extension  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1.0 Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that provides an audible alert to the user. The primary purpose is to signal the likely completion of a long-running, background AI code generation task by intelligently monitoring editor and terminal activity.

## 2.0 Scope

The extension will operate within the VS Code environment. It will monitor user interactions with the text editor and the integrated terminal. It will not interact directly with any specific AI tool's API. The sole output of the extension will be an audible system sound.

## 3.0 User Requirements

As a developer using AI code generation tools, I want to be notified with a sound when a generation task is likely complete so that I can return my attention to the code editor without constantly checking it. The notification should be smart enough to avoid firing when I am actively working, especially within the integrated terminal.

## 4.0 Functional Requirements

The system's logic for triggering an alarm is governed by a set of conditions related to code changes and terminal activity.

| ID | Requirement Description |
|:---|:---|
| **FR-01** | **Primary Trigger:** The system shall initiate an alarm countdown timer upon any detectable text change in the active editor. |
| **FR-02** | **Alarm Countdown Period:** The alarm countdown timer shall be set for a duration of **15 seconds**. |
| **FR-03** | **Activity Veto:** Any subsequent user activity within the editor (e.g., further text changes, cursor movement) during the 15-second countdown shall reset the timer. |
| **FR-04** | **Alarm Condition:** If the 15-second countdown completes without being reset, the system shall proceed to evaluate the suppression conditions before triggering the alarm. |
| **FR-05** | **Suppression Condition 1 (Immediate Terminal Use):** The alarm shall be **suppressed** if the user activates a terminal window less than **10 seconds** after the initial code change that triggered the countdown. |
| **FR-06** | **Suppression Condition 2 (Recent Terminal Use):** The alarm shall be **suppressed** if the last recorded terminal activation occurred within the last **1 minute**. |
| **FR-07** | **Alarm Action:** If the countdown completes and no suppression conditions (FR-05, FR-06) are met, the system shall play a single, standard system alert sound. |

## 5.0 Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement Description |
|:---|:---|
| **NFR-01** | **Performance:** The extension must have a negligible impact on VS Code's performance and responsiveness. |
| **NFR-02** | **Platform:** The extension must be compatible with VS Code running on Windows, macOS, and Linux. |
| **NFR-03** | **Configuration:** The time durations specified in FR-02, FR-05, and FR-06 shall be user-configurable through the VS Code settings. |
| **NFR-04** | **Reliability:** The extension must handle edge cases gracefully and not crash VS Code. |
| **NFR-05** | **User Experience:** The extension should provide clear feedback about its status and configuration options. |

## 6.0 Acceptance Criteria

- Extension activates automatically when VS Code starts
- Alarm triggers correctly after 15 seconds of inactivity following code changes
- Terminal activity properly suppresses alarms according to specified conditions
- All timing parameters are configurable through VS Code settings
- Extension works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No noticeable performance impact on VS Code operation
